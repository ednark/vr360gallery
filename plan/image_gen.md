To generate images appropriate for a 360 viewer, you’ll want to create equirectangular projections—images that cover a full 360° horizontal and 180° vertical field of view. These are typically in a 2:1 aspect ratio (e.g., 4096×2048) and wrap seamlessly when displayed in a panoramic viewer or VR environment.

Here’s a base prompt structure followed by specific examples:

🧠 Tips
	•	Include “equirectangular”, “360-degree panoramic”, and “seamless wraparound” in your prompt to help the model understand the format.
	•	Avoid placing key subjects only in one direction—use environmental scenes or interiors that look good from any angle.
	•	Test output images in a viewer like A-Frame, Three.js, or a WebXR-based viewer.
